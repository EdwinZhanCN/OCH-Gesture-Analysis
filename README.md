# Gesture-Analysis

This repository includes a minimal Next.js template website located in the `web` folder. The template provides
a multi-tab layout with pages for Home, Research, Publications, About and Resources. Each page contains placeholder
sections for content such as research highlights, methodology, demo links and related publications.

To run the site locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install # requires internet access
npm run dev
```
