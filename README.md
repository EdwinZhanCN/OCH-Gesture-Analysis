# Gesture-Analysis

This repository includes a minimal Next.js website located in the `web` folder.

About and Resources. Each page contains placeholder sections for research
highlights, methodology overviews, demos and related publications.

To run the site locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install # requires internet access
npm run dev
```

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
